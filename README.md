# Pacman 

The game of Pac-Man (PAC-MAN or Pacman[sic]) has four “ghosts” that are out to destroy the “protagonist”. Named:

1. Shadow, aka Blinky (red #FF0000); //chases pacman position
2. Speedy, aka Pinky (pink #FFB8FF); //chases 4 positions in front pacmans position
3. Bashful, aka Inky (aqua #00FFFF); //chases (pacman+2)+(blinky - (pacman + 2))
4. Pokey aka Clyde (orange #FFB852); //chases pacman position when its 8 or more tiles away from it. Otherwise, goes back to its corner
